Thanks to Ben for the CSS animation and help with the timer

# Roadmap
If I were to revisit this project I would spend more time on styling and possibly adding sound effects. The answer options change size depending on the input, so I would make those uniform, for example. I would consider combining the end of game and the high score page as separately both pages are sparce.
